# <p align="center">D3 Charting Project</p>

This project creates a data-driven chart using tools other than Python and Jupyter Notebook.
I created a simple scatter plot using the Javascript library D3. 

Using data from the **[United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)**, this chart plots all 50 states and attempts to show the relationship between the percentage of individuals with healthcare against the percentage of those below the povery line.

The data is from 




Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.


Include state abbreviations in the circles.


Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.


Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
